*bunnies be hopping*

**hop** is a lightweight bookmarking tool, intended to replace your default browser search engine. It is heavily inspired by [taneliang/neh](https://github.com/taneliang/neh), "[bunnylol](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/06/03/build-smart-bookmarking-tool-rust-rocket/)", and the original [bunny1](https://github.com/ccheever/bunny1). 

While originally written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, this version is written in TypeScript and uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for routing. It still runs on Cloudflare Wrangler.

```sh
yarn install

```
